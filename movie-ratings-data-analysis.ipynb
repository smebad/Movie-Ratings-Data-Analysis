The primary goal is to understand the distribution of ratings and identify popular movies based on these ratings. We will visualize the data using interactive charts and provide insights on the most rated movies. By the end of this notebook, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and the movie rating patterns.\n\n**Dataset Overview:**\n- **Movies dataset**: Contains information about movies including their titles and genres.\n- **Ratings dataset**: Contains user ratings for the movies.\n\nWe will merge these datasets based on the movie ID (`MovieID`) and proceed with the analysis.\n\n---","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Importing the Necessary Libraries","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing the libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"editable":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and plotly.express for creating interactive visualizations.","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Loading and Reviewing the Movies Dataset","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/movietweetings/movies.dat\", delimiter=\"::\")\ndf.head()\n","metadata":{"editable":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observations:\n* The dataset does not have column names, so we will assign them manually.","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","metadata":{"editable":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Fixing Missing Column Names:","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating the column names\ndf.columns = [\"MovieID\", \"Title\", \"Genres\"]\ndf.head()","metadata":{"editable":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 3: Loading and Reviewing the Ratings Dataset","metadata":{"editable":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/movietweetings/ratings.dat\", delimiter=\"::\")\ndf1.head()","metadata":{"editable":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observations:\n* Similar to the movies dataset, the ratings dataset lacks column names.

Below are the key takeaways:\n\n* Data Cleaning: We imported the movies and ratings datasets, assigned proper column names, and merged them into a single dataset.\n\n* Visualizing the Ratings: The distribution of ratings was visualized using a pie chart and a histogram. The analysis revealed that ratings are somewhat uniformly distributed, with a notable number of perfect scores (10/10).\n\n* Top Movies: We identified the top 10 most rated movies and the top movies that received a perfect score.\n\n* Rating Patterns: The histogram and marginal box plot gave us insights into the overall distribution of ratings, indicating a spread of ratings from 1 to 10, with some peaks at the higher end.\n\nThrough this analysis, we gained valuable insights into the movie rating patterns and identified popular movies within the dataset. This exploratory analysis provides a foundation for further analysis or modeling tasks, such as predicting movie ratings or clustering user preferences.","metadata":{"editable":false}}]}
